    <h1><span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span> layout editor, for the Macintosh</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Macintosh/ OS/X port of <span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span>, the track-layout scenario authoring tool for the <span class=nxsys>NXSYS</span> relay-logic subway signalling system.
</p>
<p>This page describes the differences between this port and the Windows "original" version of this application. It is assumed that the reader is already familiar with the latter; its original documentation <a href="tlehlptx.txt">may be found here</a>.
</p>
<p>Briefly, <span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span> allows you to create and  edit "interlocking panels", the beautiful simulated black boards with track models rendered in lights and switches by which (<span class=nxsys>NXSYS</span>) interlockings are controlled, facilitating creation and alignment of trackage and its associated signals and auxiliary controls, as well as text labels.  Due to different paradigms between operating systems and pointing devices, the rodentation models of the two versions differ somewhat.</p>

<p><span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span> does not create operative interlockings.  It allows you to author the model board–it does not design relay circuitry for you–requiring and allowing you to do that is the chief goal of <span class=nxsys>NXSYS</span>.  <span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span>'s productions lie lifeless before you.</p>

<h2>Rodentation differences</h2>
<p>All the differences here devolve from the lack of a "drag right mouse button" on the Mac.  Control-mouse-left (tapping or clicking the mouse or trackpad while holding the control key) has been substituted throughout.  I'll say "trackpad" (as I am using) even though you may be using a real mouse (in which case substitute "left button", unless you are left-handed.)</p>
<ul>
<li>To drag an extant track joint somewhere else, hold the "control" key while clicking and dragging it with the trackpad.</li>
<li>To drop a new joint into a piece of track, hold the "control" key and click where you wish to drop it.</li>
<li>Because "mouse right" is now available, "click-right" (double-finger tap) now calls up the appropriate "properties" dialog on any object (whereas heretofore it could not do so for joints and track segments).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keyboard differences</h2>
<p>In keeping with Mac conventions, <b>&#8984;X</b>, not <b>^X</b>, is now <span class=menu>Cut</span>. Because <b>&#8984;P</b> may be reserved for printing, "Properties" of the selected object are now available on <b>^P</b> (control-P).</p>
<h2>Toolbar differences</h2>
<p>The new toolbar is large and "floating"; you can move it around by dragging any part of it not a button.  The icons are much clearer than the 16x16 bit icons of the old program.  There are no more tools for <span class=menu>Exit</span>, <span class=menu>Open</span>, and <span class=menu>Save</span>; these operations have keyboard accelerators, <b>&#8984;Q</b>, <b>&#8984;O</b>, and <b>&#8984;S</b> respectively.  All of the tool buttons have "tooltips"; if you hover the mouse pointer over them for a few seconds they will show their meaning.</p>
<p>The toolbar may be hidden and called up with the <span class=menu>Show Toolbar</span> command in the <span class=menu>View</span> menu (<b>&#8997;&#8984;T</b> (option-command-T)).</p>
<h2>Other minor differences</h2>
<p><span class=menu>Set Viewpoint Here</span> and <span class=menu>Shift Layout</span> are now on the <span class=menu>View</span> menu.</p>

<p>The <b>document-modified query</b>, i.e., that asked when you attempt to quit the application or read in a new layout when you haven't saved changes you have made,  differs slightly, including its "sense", from its Windows forebear.  While the latter poses "You've made changes, do you want to write them out?", its Mac rework asks "Do you really want to quit/new file and lose your changes?", that is, you are not offered writing them out, just continuing editing. Hence, if you really want to discard your work, where you would click "no" (to "save it") to Windows, you now must click "yes" (to discard your edits) to the Mac.  The query message explains this clearly in any case.</p>


<p>There's no <span class=menu>Wipe</span> command, but a new <span class=menu>New</span> command, <b>&#8984;N</b>, in the <span class=menu>File</span> menu, with the the same effect.<p>

<p>There is a chicken-and-egg problem concerning the <b>limits of the "canvas"</b>, i.e., the area extent of the panel, viz., placing objects in empty panels created with that <span class=menu>New</span> command. The size of panels is determined when loaded by <span class=nxsys>NXSYS</span> (or <span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span>) by the objects they contain: as a new panel starts off empty and tiny, as it contains no objects, you can't place any.  To establish a large empty space capable of receiving new objects, use the new <span class=menu>Set Canvas Extent</span> command in the <span class=menu>View</span> menu, and immediately place objects as far to the right and bottom as you wish the (initial) extent to be.  The <span class=menu>New</span> command will throw
    this dialog in your face.  While this command may be used to expand a panel at any time during a first or subsequent editing session, its values are <b>not saved or restored</b> with the interlocking – the size of the panel is determined solely by the dispersion of the objects it comprises.  The initial suggestion will be that of the window size, but that does not absolve you of the need to establish your intent.</p>

<p>The relationship of the native Macintosh Font Dialog to its calling applications differs markedly from that on Windows, and some changes to the flow of the Text String Properties dialog devolve from that.  The Macintosh font and color dialogs are not modal; when exposed, you can interact with them or with the Text String Properties dialog. Furthermore, there seems a font-size incompatibility between Mac and Windows, whereby Mac fonts have be scaled down 20% to "look right" in well-designed track layouts designed on Windows; thus, when you choose a 16-point font in the Mac native font dialog, you will see "20", not "16", appear in the custom height field of the <span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span> text properties dialog, and the sample will appear 20% smaller that the number in the dialog would suggest.</p>

<h2>Yes, I know</h2>
<p><span class=nxsys>TLEdit</span> still has no <span class=menu>Undo</span>, but it's difficult to destroy much with one click or keystroke.  To be designed and done at some time..</p>
