This disk-image (.dmg) file-system contains at top level, besides this readme, 
 --  NXSYS app (NXSYSMac.app)
 -- the Track Layout Editor app (TLEdit.app)
 -- the RelayIndex command-line executable.

The documentation and the six sample interlockings are contained in
the NXSYS app and visible from its File and Help menus.

Move all three to your personal Applications folder under your home
folder, or the system Applications folder if you so choose (Admin
required for the latter).

Please visit the "Release Notes" item in the NXSYS Help menu to learn
the important changes this release!
