# Undo TBDs

Modification status in titlebar (*)  
 
Mac reshape message box if long string.

No more 0 ID joints. std::set id system.  Using IJID = long.

Crossover joint coincidence threatens whole undo system.  
Proposal: never return 10*** #'s; search for joints using them.
 
Wildfire record must save possibly inconsistent tc members.  
Must execute even if tc doesn't change for this seg.  
Strategy for cutting tagged end-joint  
  Current theory is (SEG)(JOINT)(JOINT) in recreate_form.

Switch branch undo/redo, other switch props  
 
- Disallow setting station # on uninsulated joints.
- Prohibit circuit-setting when end is not insulated.  

Undo stack before save (document how to use).  Save-point size() stack.
- may need tick-counter.

New trackage inherits circuit (better NOT)

Windows implementation  
- Menu management function 
- Add undo doc to ... something.
- Segment dialog changes
- "Insulate" icon
