# Undo TBDs

Modification status in titlebar (*)  

- Change toolbar icon.x	  
Mac reshape message box if long string.

Crossover joint coincidence threatens whole undo system.  
Proposal: never return 10*** #'s; search for joints using them.

Cut segment should cache and restore circuit.  
Wildfire record must save possibly inconsistent tc members.  
Strategy for cutting tagged end-joint  
  Current theory is (SEG)(JOINT)(JOINT) in recreate_form.

Switch branch undo/redo  
Move joint via properties dlg (doesn't undo/redo)

Joint merge (very difficult)  
- Prohibit when either is insulated or movee has station #.  
- Disallow setting station # on uninsulated joints.
- Prohibit circuit-setting when end is not insulated.  

Undo stack before save (document how to use).  Save-point size() stack.
- may need tick-counter.

New trackage inherits circuit (better NOT)

Crossover creation between extant assigned sections is a mess. Perhaps split it automatically?   (add +1 or -1 depending on actual angle?) Describe editing technique.

Windows implementation  
- Menu management function 
- Add undo doc to ... something.
- Segment dialog changes
- "Insulate" icon
