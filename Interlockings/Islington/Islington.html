<h1>Islington (Toronto) Interlocking</h1>

<p>This layout arose as part of an unconsummated deal in the late 90s
to license this system to the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC), who
expressed interest in it.  They suggested this interlocking as a test case.</p>

<p>We will present here the very minor differences between New York and Toronto conventions, and critical facts necessary for anyone operating this interlocking. Please refer to the <b>NXSYS</b> display of Islington interlocking for this discussion.</p>

<p><b>Track and Signal Numbering and designation</b></p>

<p>Tracks are called Eastbound and
Westbound. At Islington, eastbound is to the right, westbound is to the
left. Toronto numbers its signals
with odd <span class="def" dref="#DEF_sno">station numbers</span> for the
eastbound track, and even for the westbound. If a signal is in the reverse direction
or on some track than the main tracks of a 2-track line, it is labelled with an
&ldquo;A&rdquo;, e.g., &ldquo;BA-122&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;B-122&rdquo; (that
would be B1-122 and B3-122 in New York). Switch <span class="def" dref="#DEF_lever">levers</span> are odd and signals even, as in New
York.   <span class="def" dref="#DEF_tracksection">Track sections</span>
and their associated <a>relays</a> at
interlockings, like signals, are numbered by the interlocking number of the
signal controlling them (e.g., 10T), or with an &ldquo;A&rdquo; (42AT) for
&ldquo;approach&rdquo; if there is no interlocked signal controlling it; in New
York, all track sections are numbered by <span class="def" dref="#DEF_sno">station number.</span></p>

<p><b>General use and purpose of the interlocking; permissible routes</b></p>

<p>Like <a>Progman
St.,</a> Islington is a &ldquo;sometimes terminal.&rdquo; The region at the left, delimited by
signals 6, 8, 10 and 12, is a station platform. Trains can either pass right through on
the mainline tracks, or the station can be used fully or partially as a
terminal, in which trains coming westbound, from the east, can turn around in
the station and depart to the east. That is, trains entering at 48 can exit at
10 or 12, then enter at 10 or 12 and exit at 50. The center track can be used for
temporarily holding trains during such maneuvers, such as holding a second
train to destined for 10 while that pocket is occupied, as a third train goes
right by to the pocket at 12.  Note
that the third track is passable in either direction.</p>

<p>The interlocking does not permit
trains to exit it eastbound on the westbound track (at 48). There is no exit at 48. There is no exit at 18; all eastbound
traffic must leave the westbound track at 12 or 16. In the other direction, westbound trains
certainly can enter the eastbound track, to terminate at the station, but may
not go beyond signal 6, which is a <a>marker
signal.</a>. (In real life,
there is a signal 4, eastbound, to the west of 6 to further protect this move,
but we do not implement it, or 52 to the east of 48, because of screen space
limitations.) Note that reverse-direction (westbound) traffic from 50 over the
eastbound track) is permitted. Note also that there are several routes, e.g.,
from 48 to 10, for which there are three alternatives (in this case,
48-20-18-16-10, 48-44-30-16-10, 48-44-30-14-10). The interlocking uses a
&ldquo;preferencing&rdquo; algorithm when more than one is available.</p>

<p>The lower heads home signals 12 and
14 display the opposite aspect from what would be expected in New York; in
either case, green clears a movement to the track in the &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
direction, a move over switch 13 in either case, and yellow clears the other
move, i.e., into the &ldquo;reverse direction&rdquo; track.</p>

<p><b>Some <span class="def" dref="#DEF_clen">Control
Lines</span></b></p>

<p><span style='font-weight:bold;color:#0A0'>There is a signal control-line plan for Islington Interlocking, Islington.pdf, in the Islington Interlocking folder (courtesy Dave Barraza). Please refer to it in the following discussion</span>. It is <i>essential</i> to know the extents
of these control lines to understand the various <span class="def" dref="#DEF_ovlp">overlaps,</span>
crosslocks, and conflicts implicit in this interlocking.</p>

<p>Eastbound, 2's control line extends
to IJ's 127/128 on all three tracks. 10 and 12's control line extends to 44 on the center track and 42 on the
eastbound track; as stated above, they permit no moves (ultimately) to the
westbound track. 26 and 28's control lines extend out, whether via the center
track or not, past 50 to encompass its approach track section, as does 44's.</p>

<p>Westbound, 48's control line is quite complicated. When going over 45
normal down the eastbound track, it is an <a>ST</a>
signal whose &ldquo;solid&rdquo; control length extends to 16/28, and whose
&ldquo;dotted&rdquo; control length extends over both station platforms (via
switch 15) to the end, i.e., IJ 115/116. When going over 45 reverse down the center track, its control length,
shared with 50, goes to 10/12 &mdash; note that 48's control length to the station
behaves differently depending upon whether the middle track is employed. 50
over 49 normal extends all the way to the end (115/116). 20 is also ST, solid
portion to 26/28, dotted to the the end. The exact same description befits 18. 30's control length extends from itself
to the end. 16 and 14's extend one
track section <i>beyond</i> the left-hand (west) end. The <a>automatic
signals</a> at 121 on both tracks (B-122 and BA-122) are <a>GT signals,</a> timed from 14/16, control lines
also going one track section beyond the end.</p>

<p><b>Home-style <u style='text-underline:double'>approach signals</u>, as it were</b></p>

<p>Toronto makes heavy use of <a>approach signals</a> that look and act as <a=>home signals,</a> i.e., have two heads, no <a>automatic key-by,</a> require <a=>call-on</a> to pass, etc. They are not unheard of in New York (and
on unresignalled IRT, all approach signals are really one-headed home signals),
but are more heavily used in Toronto. Signals 2, 8, and 20 at Islington fit this description. They are to be considered home and
approach signals simultaneously, sort of &ldquo;absolute approach signals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><b>Auto-<a>call-on</a> <a>home signals</a></b></p>

<p>Toronto provides a feature whereby
some <a>home signals</a> act somewhat like <a>automatic</a> signals when red, if the
only reason they are red is because of a train in their <span class="def" dref="#DEF_clen">control length,</span>
i.e., not that they are not <span class="def" dref="#DEF_called">called.</span> These signals, when in that state, and
approached sufficiently slowly, typically 5 mph, display a <a>call-on</a> automatically, as it were. The train operator need not manually key-by
(see <a>call-on</a>), and no tower action
is required; the tower operator will see
the <span class="def" dref="#DEF_GK">GK light</span> flash as
the call-on is offered and accepted. Signals 12, 10, and 18 at Islington have this feature.</p>

<p><b>GT signals</b></p>

<p>While the purpose and operation of <a>GT signals</a> in Toronto is the same as in New
York, the aspects are slightly different. The two GT signals at Islington (the two <a>automatic
signals</a> at the east end of the station) are &ldquo;one shot&rdquo;. In New York, they would
have a <a">lunar white</a> to indicate
this. But in Toronto, the signals <i>before</i>
them (in this case, 14 and 16) have the lunar white aspect, which indicates
that the <i>next</i> signal is in the grade-timing state, i.e., will clear if <i>it</i>
is approached sufficiently slowly (similar to the two-shot &ldquo;S&rdquo; in New
York, but it is one-shot).</p>

<p><b>ST signals</b></p>

<p>Again, the purpose and operation of <a>ST signals</a> is the same as in New
York. Unlike as in New York, there
are no special ST aspects (e.g., the &ldquo;20&rdquo;, see <a>ST Signals.</a>)</p>

<p>Islington signals 48 (over 45 normal
only), 20, and 18 form a chain of ST signals allowing closing-on signal
16. Each of them has the
&ldquo;solid portion&rdquo; of their <span class="def" dref="#DEF_clen">control length</span> extending from
itself to signal 16, and a &ldquo;dotted portion&rdquo; from 16 on through the
west end of the station. Thus, if
signal 12 is cleared over 13 reverse for an eastbound move from the westbound
pocket via 26 to 50, all of 48, 20, and 18 can be cleared in &ldquo;restricted
form&rdquo; (see <a>Interlocked ST Signals</a>
and trains coming in from the east can close in, clearing 48, 20, and 18 in
sequence as they approach 16, which is red, protecting the reversed 13.</p>

<p>Trains created via the <b>NXSYS</b> <a>train system</a> set loose on the westbound track will actually act in this way, slowing down before these ST signals and clearing them.</p>

<p><b>Overlaps and Crosslocks</b></p>

<p>The <span class="def" dref="#DEF_ovlp">overlaps</span> of the
signals at Islington, especially 48, 50, and 30, westbound, impose very complex
conditions on switches 27 and 29 in particular, and all of the issues described
under <a>Advanced Locking Scenarios</a> must
be studied to understand all the situations in which <a>locking conflicts</a> will be indicated by flashing lights
as Islington.</p>
