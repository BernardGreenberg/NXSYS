This directory contains an implementation of Islington Interlocking of the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) in Version 2 NXSYS.  This interlocking was designed from prints provided by TTC in 1998, when that agency was considering the deployment of Version 2 NXSYS as a train-operator and tower-operator training tool (their signalling is very much like that of New York City Transit (NYCT)).

There is extensive documentation about the use, features, and peculiarities of this interlocking (including differences from NYCT) in the main  NXSYS document, accessible from all versions of the application via the "Help" menu, under the heading "Islington Interlocking."

The top-level file to be opened in NXSYS is "islingtn.trk" (note the 8-character spelling with no "o") in this directory.

There is also now a single-line control-line plan for this interlocking, generously reconstructed from the circuitry by Dave Barraza, at Islington.pdf in this directory.
