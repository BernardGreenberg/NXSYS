Upper Broadway Line (240th St) Interlocking

This Version 2 NXSYS interlocking was conceived started by Henry Sundermayer in the late 1990's. He and I (Bernard Greenberg) worked on it.  I continued and developed in since 2000, all the way into 2021.

The "root" file, i.e., the one you should open in NXSYS, is

         irt.240tl.trk  (tl for "track layout").

There is an extensive internal help text in that very file, which appears as interlocking-specific help in the application.
