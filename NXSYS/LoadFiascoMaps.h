/*  Use case:
 
 Assume files A and B contain the following.  "Register" is a function that is
 called by load-time code in many files to register objects defined in them. The
 assumption is that there are many files like A, registering their own objects.
 This architecture, having diverse files do this independently and anonymously,
 is far more modular than having the central registrar know how to call into each
 of them separately:
 
 File A:
     class foo : public generic_object { ... ... };
     generic_object* foo_fun () { return new foo(...);}
     static int dummy_var = Register("foo", foo_fun);
 File B:
     std::map<std::string, generic_object*(*)void)> creators;
     void Register (const char * key, generic_object*(*function)(void))) {
          creators[key] = function;
     }

If A appears before B in the load order, this will not work: The load-time code in A calling
"Register" will run before the load-time code in B initializing the std::map has been run,
and thus, Register will crash.  This is called the "C load order fiasco". Load order is not
really controllable in some IDE's, and ought not, or can't, be customized for single (possibly
conflicting) problems.  If, instead of std::map, LoadFiascoProtectedMap defined here is used,
the above code will work flawlessly.
 
It relies on a fairly recent enhancement to C++ that initializes elements of statically-
allocated structures declared with "inline" initializers (int foo = 3;) not at the time
that the module's static initializers are run, but at the much earlier time that ALL
modules are first loaded and "simple" static variables are initialized and contained
functions defined. That happens before ANY static initialization code is run in ANY file.

This technique works IF AND ONLY IF the structures DO NOT CONTAIN ANY ELEMENTS
REQUIRING CODE TO INITIALIZE; as can be proven below, if ANY elements do require code
to be run, the structure is re-initialized when the load-time code of the containing module
is executed, corrupting content (e.g., emptying the map by virtue of the pointer being reset
to nullptr).  By virtue of the very nature of the problem, it is not even possible to set a
switch to assert that this has not happened!
