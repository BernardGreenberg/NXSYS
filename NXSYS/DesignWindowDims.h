/* This determines the dimensions of all things, most particularly track widths, sizes
 (and thus space between) aux keys, etc.  Must concur between NXSYS and TLEdit;

  9 July 2022 - make them equal, no more "horsey" TLEdit graphics
 11 July 2022 - Mac version now zoomable.
 
 These are the dimensions of the DOS screen on which NXSYS was first designed, and
 that makes everything look right.
