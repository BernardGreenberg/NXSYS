In order to use these applications, the proper Visual C++ support DLL's must be installed.
Fortunately, all you have to do to achieve that is run the setup.exe provided right here.  Do not
run NXSYS.MSI directly; setup will run it for you after having installed the correct DLL's.

Once the applications are successfully installed, and tested by you, you can delete both
setup.exe and NXSYS.MSI.  The applications will be in your START menu.
